# Welcome to McLargo's technical wiki

## What you can find in here

This **MUST** be a dynamic documentation, constantly updated. Any new tool learn or good practice to include in my daily work must have a space in this project. Also, guidelines/ways of working applicable, no matter my current project.

Grouped in different categories:

| Topic              | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| DevOps             | Related to deployments, ci/cd...                          |
| Programming        | Directly related to programming                           |
| Project management | Project management stuff                                  |
| Utils              | Misc of other interesting utils required for daily basics |

With time and more documents covered, relation between them will be enriched. It shouldn't be a just isolated documents, but more of a wiki to cover my professional philosophy and understanding on technical topics.
