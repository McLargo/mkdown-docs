# Welcome to McLargo's documentation

## What you can find in here

This **MUST** be a dynamic documentation, constantly updated. Any new tool learn or good practice to include in my daily work must have a space in this project.

I've decided to group in different categories:

| Topic | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DevOps | Related to deployments, ci/cd... |
| Programming | Directly related to programming |
| Project management | Project management stuff |
| Utils | Misc of other interesting utils required for daily basics |

Using markdown to make it easier to build from IDE, but also nice display on github pages.
How the repo that generate this page, can be found in my github too.

## What you cannot find in here

- cheatsheets, they belong to gists
- code, that belongs to own github repository
