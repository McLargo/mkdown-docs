# Welcome to McLargo's documentation

## What you can find in here

This **MUST** be a dynamic documentation, constantly updated. Any new tool learn or good practice to include in my daily work must have a space in this project. Also, guidelines/ways of working applicable, no matter my current project.

I've decided to group in different categories:

| Topic              | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| DevOps             | Related to deployments, ci/cd...                          |
| Programming        | Directly related to programming                           |
| Project management | Project management stuff                                  |
| Utils              | Misc of other interesting utils required for daily basics |


Using [markdown](https://gist.github.com/McLargo/44c180a217f1d6c05aeff43bec82ceaa) to make it easier to build new documents from IDE. [Template sample available](template).

[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as site generator for my documentation. Easy to build, nice feature as search, with customizable layout and support deployment to github pages.

Repo that generate this website, can be found in my github.
