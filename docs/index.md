# Welcome to McLargo's technical wiki

## What you can find in here

This **MUST** be a dynamic documentation, constantly updated. Any new tool learn
or good practice to include in my daily work must have a space in this project.
Also, guidelines/ways of working applicable, no matter my current project.

Grouped in different categories:

| Topic              | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture       | Related to patterns, architecture designs...   |
| DevOps             | Related to deployments, ci/cd...               |
| Programming        | Directly related to programming                |
| Project management | Project management stuff                       |
| Utils              | Misc of other utils required for daily basics  |

With time and more documents covered, relation between them will be enriched. It
shouldn't be a just isolated documents, but more of a wiki to cover my
professional philosophy and understanding on technical topics.

Using
