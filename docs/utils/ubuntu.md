# Ubuntu

I am using ubuntu, a linux distro based on Debian. It is open source, with a big community and support for common issues.

## Oh my zsh

Ubuntu has a default shell, to run different commands, but there are others like zsh. To add more power to the shell, I used `Oh my zsh` on top. It is open source, big collaborative community, customizable and with many plugins to enable to enrich the experience of working with a terminal.

## dotfiles

Private files in a Linux os. Usually, they contain configuration used by different tools, like terminal, profile, k8s, git...
It can be used to speed up [installation](https://github.com/McLargo/installation) of a new OS from scratch.
Totally customizable with my needs.
