# IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to
consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program. It helps you
editing your source code, debugging, and auto-completing.

## Sublime

Simple, light and robust. It has everything I need to work with python.
Installation by default on [my .dotfiles](../ubuntu/#dotfiles)

## VS Code

VS Code is the perfect IDE for web development. It has a lot of plugins,
customizable themes, and a lot of features. It can be used for other languages,
it includes a terminal, and it is very fast.
