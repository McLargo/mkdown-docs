# IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to
consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program. It helps you
editing your source code, debugging, and auto-completing.

## Sublime

Simple, light and robust. It has everything I need to work with python.
Installation by default on [my .dotfiles](../ubuntu/#dotfiles)

## VS Code

New, popular and complete. Let's give it a try to this IDE.
