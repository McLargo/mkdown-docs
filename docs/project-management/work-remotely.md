# Work remotely

In modern world, and specially after COVID-19 pandemic, work remotely is a reality for IT sector.
Luckily, I have been working in companies with high compromise and respect for work remotely. And I like it :)

Some key notes to take into consideration:

- Trust people
- Data driven
- Think beyond schedule
- Promote async communication
- Better planning with less distractions
