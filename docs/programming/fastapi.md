# FastApi

It is a python framework to build quickly restful API's. It is nice, modern, and
with good performance. It has [Openapi](../openapi) implementation by default,
you don't need to manually create and maintain openapi.yaml. By default, fastApi
generates automatically openapi document.

Uses pydantic for models, for data validations.

Support [async](../python#async) by default too, enriching performance even
faster. Careful when using async + DB.
