# Open API

TODO: fulfill
## Why is needed?

It provides human and machine readable information about your REST API you are devolving
It is a nice tool to share information internally and externally. People knows in which stage we are, what kind of response are expected... everything is shared in a common place.

two different aproach

COde FIrst or Open APi specification first

Well it depends. If requirements are not quite clear, may be good idea to start develop and create open api later
