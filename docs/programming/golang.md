# Golang

Golang or commonly known as Go, it is a programming language designed by Google.

- statically typed: once a variable is set, you cannot change its type.
- compiled programming language: Go is compiled directly to machine code, making
  it faster than interpreted languages.
- garbage-collected: Go has a garbage collector that automatically manages memory.
- concurrent: Go has built-in support for concurrent programming. You can run
  [multiple tasks concurrently](../architecture/patterns/concurrency-patterns.md),
  making more efficient code. Go uses goroutines and channels to achieve this.
  You need to give a little bit of thought how you program your code.
